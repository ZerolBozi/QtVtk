# Study QtVtk
___

This is my school project for a class called Data Structure and learning C++, Qt, Vtk

The project reference is at https://github.com/nicanor-romero/QtVtk

And code was tested on Windows with Qt 5.9.4 and VTK 8.2.0.

## Build example (bash)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZerolBozi/QtVtk.git
cd QtVtk
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ./src
```
